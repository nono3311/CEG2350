> Your reflection here
3. Did you write good `commit` messages that refer to what tasks were completed at each commit?  What would you improve?
> Your reflection here
> Yes, I used python and it was pretty familiar with the expression while, if and the random
3. Did you write good `commit` messages that refer to what tasks were completed at each commit? Yes I did but for the two first steps  thought it was personal notes so I was just telling I'm doing my homework but I correct the for last ones stating what i am doing in my scripts.  What would you improve? 
> Your reflection here: More details, because the first and last scripts are differents and I should have stated more stuff in my commits in case someone wants to track it.
